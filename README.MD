README
------------

Openblocks is a open source project intended to be an alternative to Roblox,
and cane about from the recently awful management on Roblox currently.

If you wish to modify, add onto, or enhance our client, you are very much
welcomed and highly encouraged to do so.

I hope you enjoy our attempt at making an alternative!

-----

Openblocks is welcoming of any help on ideas and improving our code as we can get,
so if you are looking to have a feature show up in the project, please contact either
jahoobas or trulyflawed on Discord (Those are the usernames).

If you are going to contact any of us, please mention Openblocks in the message so 
that we are aware of what you are talking about.

Thank you for reading!
