Openblocks is a open source project intended to be an alternative to Roblox.

If you wish to add to our client, you are welcome to do so.

I hope you enjoy!

We will welcome any help we can get, so if you want a feature to show up in the project, 
please contact me on Discord with the username jahoobas. (I know the new update sucks.)

If you are going to contact me, please mention Openblocks in the message so I will know what the 
message is about.

Thank you!
